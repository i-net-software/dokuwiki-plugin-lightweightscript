LeightWeightScript Plugin for DokuWiki

Adds an "Editor and better only" script part and removes a lot of
unneeded scripts parts for non editors. It makes the JS for end users
a lot smaller and faster to load.

All documentation for this plugin can be found at
http://www.inetsoftware.de

If you install this plugin manually, make sure it is installed in
lib/plugins/inetmodifications/ - if the folder is called different it
will not work!

Please refer to http://www.dokuwiki.org/plugins for additional info
on how to install plugins in DokuWiki.
